    <h3 id="keynote"  class="cgo-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Opaque Pointers Are Coming <br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
    <p>TLLVM is currently finalizing the migration from typed pointers (i32*) to opaque pointers (ptr)
        -- the likely largest intermediate representation change in LLVM's history. In this talk,
        we'll discuss the motivations for the change, how it will affect developers working on/with
        LLVM in practice, and why this migration took such a long time. We'll also briefly cover
        possible future IR changes based on opaque pointers.
    </p>


    <h3 id="hot-path"  class="cgo-title" style="font-weight: bold;">The Hot Path SSA Form in LLVM<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
    <p>The Static Single Assignment (SSA) form is the most popular representation used in
            the LLVM compiler system. The SSA form has been affable to the design of simpler algorithms for existing
            optimizations and has facilitated the development of new ones. However, speculative
            optimizations&mdash;optimizations targeted towards speeding up the &ldquo;common cases&rdquo; of a
            program&mdash;have not been fortunate enough to savor an SSA-like intermediate form.</p>

    <p>We build the Hot Path SSA (HPSSA) Form within the LLVM infrastructure to facilitate
            the design of speculative analyses and optimizations by allowing only hot reaching definitions (definitions
            along frequent acyclic paths in the program profile) to reach their respective uses. We also demonstrate how
            the HPSSA form can be effective in easily building speculative variants of existing &quot;standard&quot;
            analyses by building a SpecSCCP pass &mdash;a speculative variant of Wegman and Zadeck&rsquo;s Sparse
            Conditional Constant Propagation algorithm.</p>


    <h3 id="poset-rl" class="cgo-title" style="font-weight: bold;">POSET-RL: Phase ordering for Optimizing Size and
              Execution Time using Reinforcement Learning<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>

      <p>The ever increasing memory requirements of several applications has led to increased
              demands which might not be met by embedded devices. Constraining the usage of memory in such cases is of
              paramount importance. It is important that such code size improvements should not have a negative impact on
              the runtime. Improving the execution time while optimizing for code size is a non-trivial but a significant
              task.</p>

      <p>The ordering of standard optimization sequences in modern compilers is fixed, and are
              heuristically created by the compiler domain experts based on their expertise. However, this ordering is
              sub-optimal, and does not generalize well across all the cases.</p>

      <p>We present a reinforcement learning based solution to the phase ordering problem,
              where the ordering improves both the execution time and code size. We propose two different approaches to
              model the sequences: one by manual ordering, and other derived from Oz sequences by creating a graph called
              Oz Dependence Graph (ODG). Our approach uses minimal data as training set, and is integrated with
              LLVM.</p>

      <p>We show results on X86 and AArch64 architectures using the benchmarks from SPEC-CPU
              2006, SPEC-CPU 2017 and MiBench. We observe that the proposed model based on ODG outperforms the Oz sequence
              both in terms of size and execution time by 6.19% and 11.99% in SPEC 2017 benchmarks, on an average.
      </p>


    <h3 id="learning-combine" class="cgo-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Learning to combine Instructions in LLVM
            Compiler<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
    <p>Instruction combiner (IC) is a critical compiler optimization pass, which replaces a
            sequence of instructions with an equivalent and optimized instruction sequence at basic block level. There
            can be thousands of instruction-combining patterns which need to be frequently updated as new coding
            idioms/applications and novel hardware evolve over time. This results in frequent updates to the IC
            optimization pass thereby incurring considerable human effort and high software maintenance costs. To
            mitigate these challenges associated with the traditional IC, we design and implement a Neural Instruction
            Combiner (NIC) and demonstrate its feasibility by integrating it into the standard LLVM compiler
            optimization pipeline.</p>

    <p>NIC leverages neural sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models for generating optimized
            encoded IR sequence from the unoptimized encoded IR sequence. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the
            first work demonstrating the feasibility of a neural instruction combiner built into a full-fledged compiler
            pipeline. Given the novelty of this task, we built a new dataset for training our NIC neural model. We show
            that NIC achieves exact match results percentage of 72\% for optimized sequences as compared to traditional
            IC and neural machine translation metric Bleu precision score of 0.94, demonstrating its feasibility in a
            production compiler pipeline.</p>

    <h3 id="tutorial-guide" class="cgo-title" style="font-weight: bold;">[Tutorial] An Guide to Performance Debugging LLVM-based Programs<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
    <p>LLVM is a compiler infrastructure that has become the foundation of a variety of
            compilers and languages including C/C++, Fortran, Rust, Swift, Julia, and more. When a user of an LLVM-based
            compiler is writing a program, it is unfortunately and surprisingly easy to shoot one self in the foot and
            inadvertently write code that prevents optimization.</p>

    <p>This talk will provide viewers with an introduction to performance debugging in LLVM,
            covering a variety of common tools and techniques such as profilers and optimization remarks. This talk will
            also provide users with the the necessary tools to solve advanced performance engineering mysteries
            including LLVM optimizations inadvertently not applying to programs. The talk will conclude by discussing
            two recent performance engineering mysteries that arose on LLVM main: a change to phase ordering that
            accidentally resulted in LICM needless removing alias and range information
            (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/53794), and the increasing importance and ubiquity of hardcoded

      Flang - experiences with a new compiler<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
    <p>LLVM Flang is a new Fortran frontend and a compiler driver in LLVM, using MLIR as an
          intermediate step before generating LLVM-IR. SNAP is a physics application of medium size, written in
          Fortran 95 and using OpenMP and MPI for parallelism. This talk will discuss the trials and tribulations of
          compiling some thousands of lines of Fortran source code (SNAP) with a new compiler (LLVM Flang).</p>

    <p>LLVM Flang is still work-in-progress. This is the first time that a large Fortran
          application is compiled with LLVM Flang in a way that allows to benchmark it against other Fortran
          compilers. I will discuss my approach for measuring the performance and compare the results with GFortran
          and the Classic Flang. This initial study has revealed a number of areas for improvement to LLVM Flang code
          generation that would show better performance on SNAP, and beyond!</p>


    <h3 id="anatomy-optimized" class="cgo-title"  style="font-weight: bold;">An Anatomy of Optimized Matrix Multiplication on
      AArch64<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
    <p>This proposal presents our work in optimizing double-precision floating-point General
            Matrix Multiply (GEMM), which computes a matrix fma (fused multiply add) between three source matrices
            C+=A*B. For double precision GEMM, we were able to achieve 9.7 GFLOPs, which is close to the theoretical
            maximum of 10.4 GFLOPs under the conditions of our testing machine. In addition, we also achieved a cache
            miss rate of only 0.2%. This GEMM IR will be shipped together with Huawei&#39;s BiSheng compiler, a compiler
            based on the open source LLVM project. The presentation will focus on how to best use the techniques for
            high-performance GEMM.</p>

    <p>There are many well-established optimization techniques for GEMM, but their
            effectiveness doesn&#39;t scale well over a wide range of matrix sizes. To obtain an optimized MM for a
            general size, from the small to the large, the challenge is to choose the appropriate techniques for
            different matrix sizes, and how to best combine the techniques and sizes together. For example, on AArch64,
            a 4-by-4 MM micro-kernel is small enough to be fitted into the available NEON vector registers for
            vectorization, but as the matrix size increases, register pressure starts to appear, and vectorization loses
            effectiveness as reloads of the source matrix elements into the vector registers become necessary. As
            another example of a technique whose effectiveness degrades with size, the technique of outer product
            expansion in MM inherently supports loop invariant code motion and gives very good performance for
            128-by-128 MM, but as the matrix size increases into the thousands and cache locality decreases, the
            performance gain from outer products quickly degrades, and tiling and packing are needed to improve
            caching.</p>

    <p>We will demonstrate how to best choose the matrix sizes for the micro- and
            macro-kernels based on the platform. We present optimized GEMM on AArch64 for the small, medium and large
            sizes: a 4-by-4 MM micro-kernel hand-vectorized with the NEON vector infrastructure, a 128-by-128
            macro-kernel optimized with outer product expansion, and the thousand-sized GEMM optimized with tiling and
            packing. Alongside a tutorial of these techniques themselves, we will demonstrate how to best use the MM
            kernel of a smaller size in the MM of a larger size, and provide a deeper understanding of why each
            technique is most effective on its corresponding matrix size.</p>


    <h3 id="improving-openmp" class="cgo-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Improving the OpenMP Offloading Driver: LTO, libraries,
            and toolchains<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
      <p>This technical talk will describe the work done to improve the clang driver for
              generating OpenMP offloading applications. The talk will detail the motivations behind this change, the
              implementation and function of the new driver, and the features and performance this new approach provides.
              Features such as device link time optimization, static libraries, and tool-chain unification greatly improve
              both the performance and usability of LLVM&#39;s OpenMP offloading support. I will mention the performance
              improvements found for some applications that make heavy use of split compilation, something that is
              notoriously slow for regular CUDA codes.</p>

    <h3 id="crash-analyzer" class="cgo-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Crash-Analyzer: An LLVM-based Tool for Triaging and
            Analyzing Crashes<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
    <p>Crash-Analyzer is an LLVM-based tool that bridges the gap between triaging and fixing
            a bug. We introduce compiler technology and analyses to discover and reason about semantics of crashing
            program. The Crash-Analyzer consists of Corefile Reader, Decompiler, and Analyzer. It takes a corefile and
            the corresponding executable binary and attempts to identify the function that is responsible for the crash.
            Crash-Analyzer also outputs a backward taint data flow graph which can be helpful for developers.</p>

    <h3 id="prototyping-compiler" class="cgo-title" style="font-weight: bold;">Prototyping a compiler for homomorphic encryption using
            MLIR<br/><span style="font-size: x-small;"><a href="#workshop-schedule"> &#9650; back to schedule</a></span></h3>
    <p>Homomorphic encryption is an encryption scheme in cryptography that provides a set of
            operations on encrypted data.
       Among homomorphic encryption schemes, CKKS provides efficient but approximate
            operations on real numbers.
    CKKS encrypts a plaintext as a pair of large integer polynomials, and its homomorphic
            operations are defined as a series of polynomial operations on them.
    Thus, the implementations of CKKS operations typically contain many loops on large
            arrays representing polynomials.
    Successfully applying loop optimizations can significantly boost the performance of
            the operations.</p>

    <p>In this talk, we introduce a prototype of a compiler for homomorphic encryption using
            MLIR.</p>
    <p>It takes a program that describes polynomial operations and compiles it into LLVM
            IR.</p>
    <p>Our prototype can compile decryption/encryption, and the generated code is at most
            40% faster when run in 32 threads than the C++ implementation written using Intel HEXL.</p>

    <p>In this talk, we show the details of the lowering process from Source
    Fortran code to LLVMIR, through the Fortran Dialect of MLIR e.g FIR.
    We walk the listeners through an example OpenMP construct (SIMD) and
    showcase how to design the lowering pipeline. This talk will immensely
    be helpful to future contributors to the LLVM-Flang OpenMP project.</p>
