<p>The LLVM Developers' Meeting is a bi-annual gathering of the entire LLVM Project community. The conference is organized by the LLVM Foundation and many volunteers within the LLVM community.

Whether you are a new to the LLVM project or a long time member, there is something for each attendee.

<p>What can you can expect at an LLVM Developers' Meeting?
<dl>

<dt><b>Tutorials</b></dt>
<dd>Tutorials are 45-50 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical topic. Expect in depth examples and explanations.</dd>

<dt><b>Lightning Talks</b></dt>
<dd>These are fast 5 minute talks that give you a taste of a project or topic. Attendees will hear a wide range of topics and probably leave wanting to learn more.</dd>

<dt><b>Quick Talks</b></dt>
<dd>Quick 10 minute talks that dive a bit deeper into a topic, but not as deep as a Technical Talk.</dd>

<dt><b>Student Technical Talks</b></dt>
<dd>Graduate or Undergraduate students present their work using LLVM.</dd>

<dt><b>Panels</b></dt>
<dd>Panel sessions are guided discussions about a specific topic. The panel consists of ~3 developers who discuss a topic through prepared questions from a moderator. The audience is also given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel.
</dd>
